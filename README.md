# HBase2AWS

DISCLAIMER

!!! NO WARRANTY !!!
HBase it this environment work so-so. 
Need to configure much more for real using.

###

Before start have to:
1. Install ams
2. Create private key and call it key_unix.pem
3. If no connection configure Inbound and Outbound rules for security groups in AWS Console (open ports for your IP, don't open for all it is unsafe)

Run run-all.sh - it should do all work
